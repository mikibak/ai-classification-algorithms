It is a magazine for those who love antiques and also those who consider themselves historians since many articles deal with historical collections of art and antiques.\n\nThis magazine is overflowing with antique goods and information. The articles contained in this magazine are intended to be visually stimulating in some cases, educational in others. They offer history lessons on the art that was popular during a specific era, a glimpse into an art collection at a museum, and more. The articles are meant to stimulate the interests of those who already like this subject and they often provide a means to learn more, to discover places to see or purchase some of the featured works, and to develop an appreciation for the craftsmanship that went into making these items.\n\nAntiques Magazine is a publication dedicated to creative art and history but one thing that isn't very creative is the titles of the articles. This might surprise some readers at first, but the editors at Antiques decided to get straight to the point in the naming of the featured articles rather than try to be creative. The features thus have titles like \"The Eating Utensil Collection\", \"Spanish Culture in Art\", etc. Each title points out exactly what the article covers, leaving nothing to the imagination.\n\nThe writing in Antiques is certainly good and well- edited. But I'm afraid that many readers will find the articles a little boring. They describe things well and they usually offer a good history lesson. But they lack spark and readability. I have tried to read some articles in this magazine and found my eyelids getting heavy and my thoughts drifting to other subjects. This is why I generally stick with the pictures when I glance at Antiques Magazine. I don't bother reading because most of the material doesn't keep my interest.\n\nOverall, Antiques Magazine is an okay publication and unless you have a deep interest in antiques and their history, you will likely become bored quickly if you try to read the articles. But the pictures in Antiques are often very interesting. Even if you have little interest in reading a magazine like this one, the photos alone make it worth an occasional look.", "summary": "Antiques Magazine is Good, but not for Everyone", "unixReviewTime": 1174694400}

That makes it very easy to read while at the same time it is imparting in-depth technical know-how.\n\n If you are a newbie, in no time you possess expert knowledge of computers and, to an extent, of electronics.\n\nIf you are already advanced, then you get even more advanced. Period.\n\nAs an MPC reader you naturally become the PC nerd amongst your friends, family, and coworkers, that everybody keeps coming to for advise and requests for help.\n\nFor instance at the launch of new operating system, such as with windows 8, and win 7, you'll get mobbed by confused hordes of PC users with a lost sense of direction.\n\nYou become their sole bastion of hope standing solidly there in the middle, that they can hold on to for guidance.\n\nThere are also little tid bits of information that can unexpectedly result in huge payoffs. In a little corner in one issue for example, they showed how to insert a check mark in my Utorrent software, that encrypted its outgoing traffic, so that my ISP couldn't invade my privacy anymore, and so had to stop bothering and threatening me about my sharing of copyrighted materials with my friends. That was a relief!\n\nI also like the fact that the magazine deals with both computer hardware, and software - though the emphasis is on hardware.\n\nThere are also letters to the computer doctor who diagnoses and then gives good advice on a range of computer illnesses and hiccups.\n\nYou also get the latest news taking place in the tech world and on copyright issues.\n\nOverall It is a well rounded publication with a little for everyone, young and old, great and small.\n\nI have the kindle for Ipad version, and it is the absolute best.

The magazine's writing and tone always felt just about right and in the days before Internet, was the only way to actually get good information about hardware.

And to the writers credit, they have changed content slightly to highlight articles that do not suffer from a few months delay.\n\nI work in a circulation department for another magazine and I get all the frustration magazine customers have at slow delivery, fulfillment of old issues and all those many many ads. My only defense is where else can you get an hour (or so) entertainment for 42 cents a month? Even double that price is still an insanely low price for such quality content.\n\nI'm glad I'm back on board after all these years. Sure I have the Internet for the day 1 reviews of new hardware launches and 10 page articles on tweaks to get 1 FPS more out of Skyrim but truthfully my patience for that type of involvement with my computer has dropped considerably.

At the top of the page is a sentence stating that you must call a certain phone number to cancel or change subscriptions. So those two buttons are... the modern day racing stripes for a web site with no function at all, mererly appearance?

And Details is not a magazine that seems to have its hand on the\npulse of the nation. More often than not, you skim through, looking for something interesting to read, and close it finding none. And in a men's interest/fashion magazine, nothing is more important than the photos. Unfortunately they are not that great. The photo spreads are way too short. But since the photographers have taken amatuerish or just poorly done\nphotographs, it actually works out. Basically what you have with\nDetails is a magazine that wants to be one of the big boys, but hasn't found a way to get there.

I will cut to the chase about why I subscribe to it and the reason why most everyone else out there does too - it's those program CD-ROMs that include a ton of things that you can use that are mostly all free. Yah, I can go out and find them myself instead of having the CD-ROM at your disposal, but often you do not know what you are looking for when you search online for a solution or program... ... or your search engine overlooks a program(s) out there that you want. There are tons of handy and very useful tools and utilities on them.  It saves me a lot of work searching. This is the plus.\nNow, the magazine articles are okay. Lately, I have found that they are discussing issues not of importance to me. I am seeing more ads in them than the older issues that had better old core help providing assistance with common programs users have and solutions to common issues. Once in a while I find in an issue an article I like that serves some use, but it is now hit or miss. It used to be that EVERY issue had some practical assistance I could use. Again, the reason that I subscribe is those CD-ROMs, I will not lie here.\nNow, the latest issue I am having with them is there subscription renewal service after you have had them for one year (or more) and they tell you that you need to renew when you haven't finished receiving all your paid subscription issues. They tell you that you HAVE received (in my case) all 12 issues when I have only received 10 to date. They state that they expect to receive you payment for renewal when you haven't finished your first year subscription service. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE HERE! I still have 2 issues before my current subscription is done.  I believe that I will pay them when my renewal is done. After I receive my last two (2) issues for this subscription period, them I will pay to renew for the next subscription period. The reason why I do not pay in advance is I will get short changed and it makes it very difficult to correct this issue at a later date.  I had an issue with this and I need it resolved, so I contacted their customer service department via e-mail.  They replied back to me promptly. They stated that my last two issues were in the mailing process and my current subscription period will expire in November 2010 which is correct. I agree when it will expire. We are on the same page here. However, \"when payment is received, service will continue through the October 2010 issue.\" Now, this is B.S. They are holding back on my last 2 issues that I paid for until they receive my payment. What if I did NOT want to renew this magazine? Does this mean I do not get my last 2 issues (Oct. & Nov. 2010) that I paid for? This is not fair business practices!!! They are still obligated to still send me my last 2 issues regardless if I renew or not. I am a little angered here. Yes, I like the magazine for obvious reasons and I will renew; but this is not fair at all! This is some deceptive marking trick to keep you subscribed and keep you paying to receive all your issues you already paid for!", "summary": "It Is A Good Magazine, But They Have Sly Renewal Practices.", "unixReviewTime": 1282262400}

Almost like the magazine became noting more than bowing down to each company with the exception of a few bad apples that were just too bad to seriously give a good review.\n\nAnother thing is that I know of a lot of people who are current subscribers to this MP, and even they get a laugh at all the repeated stories/tutorials shown in such great detail but forgetting some of the most crutial factors.  Some of the the ones off the top of my head that seemed to read well eventually completely skipped like actually burn a dvd via a chosen suite.  It focused on rather large 'OK' buttons,  random option, and yet reading it time and time again, the \"how to burn a dvd\" other than what options are never unveiled to the reader.\n\nI wish the days of a rare 11 rating came along or really give a reason to purchase the magazine instead of the website as I am all for magazine support (when tiny url's themselves is a great debate in security alone).
